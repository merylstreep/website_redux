as a young padawan i was keen to see how far the fundamentals of\n            thermodynamics and fluid mechanics i sponged up ran in real science\n            and asked around the faculty for an opportunity to work in the labs.\n            i got involved only because i knew one of the lead researchers from\n            a friend's dad who's best friends with their partner (networking!).\n            my work was centered about aeroacoustics which is which is the study\n            of noise generation under turbulent fluid motion. it doesn't sound\n            too interesting, so to put its relevance into perspective consider\n            the following truths:\n          </Typography>\n          <ul id={\"aeroacoustics-facts\"}>\n            <li id={\"aero-fact-1\"} key={\"aero-fact-1\"}>\n              <Typography variant={\"body2\"}>\n                sound is energy waste from a system (noise from your engine are\n                mainly kinetic losses)\n

    <Typography variant={\"body2\"}>\n                and, the faster things go the more sound they produce (rockets\n                are louder than jets which are louder than planes which are\n                louder than trains, etc)\n              </Typography>\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n          <Typography variant={\"body2\"}>\n            if we simplify the total available energy of a object to its\n            potential and kinetic energy minus its losses (sound) it follows tht\n            the total available energy to move things faster increases if we\n            reduce our losses. therefore, by understanding how we can make\n            things quieter, we can make things more energy efficient and\n            ultimately faster.\n          </Typography>\n
